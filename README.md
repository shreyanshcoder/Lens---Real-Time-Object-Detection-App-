# Lens---Real-Time-Object-Detection-App-
It is an application which will detect objects from images and name the object detected.      
It allows people to gain information about what objects are being shown in an image. It also helps people surf for products that they see around them ( a modified usage of the project) and it makes people know more about what is around them.
Some more uses of this application can be to be further used for real time object detection in videos (live) and can be used by blind people to detect object around them.
